These scripts were created to automate the update process of http://kino.pub/ plex plugin.
To get a fully automated update process for you plex server these scripts also need the power of https://github.com/mrworf/plexupdate scrtipt.

I made these scripts for my own convinience so plese do not tell me if something is not working on your machine. They are very simple and you can change them to make them working on your own machine whenever you want ))

System requirements:
- python 3
- ubuntu 16.04
- sudo/root priviledges to add job to cron, restart services and update plugin bindle
